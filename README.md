- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristian Suarez from Argentina.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in QA automation and VR/MR/AR. Iâ€™m trying to combine these two passions and make a living through them.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all kinds of technologies. Iâ€™m already working for a company as a QA automation engineer using Selenium, Java, C#, and Cucumber, but in the future, I would also like to develop apps for Virtual Reality.
